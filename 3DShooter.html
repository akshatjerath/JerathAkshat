							<p>It was a part of my university course work. My goal was to create a game which has different character movements in each level. 
                                I ended up making 3 levels with 3 different movement styles. This game includes music/sound, working enemies who can also shoot, fully working UI and many power-ups.
                                I made this game in 3 weeks and few sprites in the game were made by me in photoshop and few were found from google.In the end I learnt about the unity engine and few tools in photoshop</p>
